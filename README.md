# Optimally Improving Cooperative Learning in a Social Setting

This repository contains the code associated with the paper "Optimally Improving Cooperative Learning in a Social Setting" by Shahrzad Haddadan, Cheng Xin, and Jie Gao. This research was presented at the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

## Abstract

We consider a cooperative learning scenario where a collection of networked agents with individually owned classifiers dynamically update their predictions for the same classification task through communication or observations of each otherâ€™s predictions. This project includes a polynomial-time algorithm for optimizing the aggregate objective function and approximation algorithms for the egalitarian improvement.

## Introduction

In this project, we explore how to optimally fix the predictions of a few classifiers in a network to maximize the overall accuracy. We present solutions for both aggregate and egalitarian objectives, providing mathematical analysis and experimental validation on synthetic and real datasets.
